- Agent's follows these Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation And Avoidance  rules  to create birds or groupof fish like behaviour's
- Alignment => Agent's look for its nearest neighbour with in its radius. It add's all those direction and move towards its resulant normalize direction with its speed
- Cohesion =>  Agent's look for its nearest neighbour with in its radius. It add's all those positions of it  neighbour and get the midpoint of those agents and move towards its resulant normalize direction with its speed
- Spereation =>  Agent's look for its nearest neighbour with in its radius. It add's all those direction and move opposite  towards the resultant normalize direction with its speed
- Avoidance => Agent lookes with in its radius , if it find that there is some obstacle then it move opposite direction
